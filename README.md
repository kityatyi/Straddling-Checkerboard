Straddling Checkeboard

Contains a few different straddling checkerboard presets to be used for text encryption. More presets can easily be added. Currently three-row checkerboards only are accepted.

Any of the preset checkerboards can be selected for the encryption. The function encrypts a string of text entered to a string of numbers using the checkerboard selected. It removes any characters apart from A-Z. Additionally, it is possible to include further characters by adding them in the relevant line of code.
