Straddling Checkerboard

Contains a few different straddling checkerboard presets to be used for text encryption. More presets can easily be added. Currently, three-row checkerboards only are accepted.

Any of the presets can be selected for use. The function encrypts a string of text to a string of numbers by using the checkerboard selected. By default, it removes any characters apart from A-Z. Additionally, it is possible to include or exclude characters by adding them in removing them from the relevant line of code.
