Straddling Checkerboard

Contains a few different straddling checkerboard presets to be used for text encryption. More presets can easily be added using the constructor. The checkerboard library can hold and activate any checkerboard variation.

Any of the presets can be selected for use. The function encrypts a string of text to a string of numbers by using the board selected. By default, it removes non A-Z characters. Additionally, it is possible to include or exclude characters by adding or removing them from the relevant line of code.

1.1
